##  **Course Description**

This course is designed for forward-thinking business leaders who seek to understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its transformative impact on the business world. You will embark on a journey through the history and evolution of AI, gaining insights into how these technologies have shaped and will continue to revolutionize various industries. We will explore the ethical considerations and societal implications of AI, ensuring you are equipped to make responsible decisions in a technology-driven future.

Diving deeper, the course offers a primer on foundational AI concepts, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks, text embeddings, clustering, transformers, and large language models (LLMs). While the technical aspects are simplified for a business-oriented audience, you will gain enough understanding to effectively communicate with technical teams and leverage AI in business contexts. A significant focus will be on the application of LLMs to solve real-world business challenges.

By the end of this course, you will not only have a thorough understanding of AI technologies but also possess the strategic mindset to lead AI initiatives and drive innovation in your organization. Whether you are aspiring to be a C-suite executive, an entrepreneur, or a business strategist, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to succeed in the AI-augmented business landscape.

The course integrates pre-recorded video lectures with interactive live sessions to provide an engaging and hands-on learning experience, making it accessible and enjoyable for non-technical beginners in AI.

##  **Final Project**

The final project, to be completed by the same team as your Homework Assignments, will require your team to propose a business task or process that can be automated or made more efficient using the AI tools learned in class.

The expected output is a presentation describing and motivating the business problem/task/process along with a proposed AI proof-of-concept solution. Students may choose to code a custom GPT model or an object detection project as part of this course. More details will be provided in Live Session 2, and guidance will be offered throughout the process. Before the AI Hackathon in Live Session 3, AM will also set up team consultation hours, where teams can brainstorm and consult on their ideas. Attendance at these consultation hours is highly encouraged. Please take note of the scheduled time and date.

##  **Zoom Link**

This class is hybrid. If you would like to attend via Zoom, please refer to the Zoom link attached in the calendar invite sent to you.

## **Attendance**

Students are expected to attend all class sessions and actively participate in class. Given the compressed and rigorous nature of ASB classes, absences can have a detrimental impact on individual and team academic performance. Student attendance is critical towards contributing a diverse array of perspectives to the classroom discussion. Consequently, a lack of attendance (too few engaged students in a class) will compromise each student’s learning experience. 

Students are expected to be punctual by arriving in class on time and stay for the entire duration. The AM or faculty have the final say of what is considered attendance.

If the student cannot attend a class, the student is responsible for notifying faculty, AMs, and the Program Offices of the absences, by email, at least two hours before class, except for exceptional circumstances. More than 80% attendance is required to receive a certificate of attendance and to be eligible for HRDF/company claims.

We do not offer make-up sessions. If you cannot attend in person, please attend via Zoom. For those whose companies are claiming government funding (e.g., HRDF), remember to sign at the table outside whenever you attend in person.

If you are sick or have unavoidable circumstances that prevent you from attending a class, even via Zoom, please email us at [**aceacademic@asb.edu.my**](mailto:aceacademic@asb.edu.my) as soon as possible.

**Academic Integrity and Honesty**

As a member of the ASB academic community, the highest standards of academic behavior are expected of you. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of the standards and adhere to them. These standards are discussed above, specifically regarding plagiarism, individual work, and team work.

This discussion of academic honesty is not exhaustive, and there may be areas that remain unclear to you. If you are unsure whether some particular course of action is proper, it is your responsibility to consult with your instructor and/or Academic Manager for clarification.

When preparing cases and assignments you should not receive input from anyone who has already participated in a faculty-led discussion of the same material, be it at Sloan or another school. In addition, you should work alone when preparing graded individual assignments. When preparing graded team assignments, your discussions should be strictly limited to the members of your team. When preparing any graded assignment, you may not consult or use material not already included in the course packet or posted on the course webpage, unless this has been explicitly authorized by the instructor. In particular, using material from previous editions of this course or courses offered at other schools is strictly prohibited. Also, no individual may be listed as a co-author of a team assignment unless that person has contributed to the work submitted in a substantial manner. Each member of the team is fully responsible for ensuring that each submitted assignment is done according to the expected professional standards and the academic integrity policy.

If at any point during the course you are unsure about appropriate adherence to the academic integrity policy, or if its implications in your particular situation are not completely clear, you should immediately contact the instructor for clarification.

**Note that** this policy implies in particular that you should:

* Never ask for/obtain/use hints or material relative to an assignment from any student or alumnus who has already taken the session;

* Never perform a search on the Internet to find information relative to a graded assignment, unless such access has been approved as appropriate in a given situation.

Academic standards violations will result in disciplinary action. Possible consequences include grade reduction, a failing F grade, a transcript notation, delay of graduation, or expulsion from ASB.

We reserve the right to terminate enrolment and remove learners from the course, without refund of the course fees, if we find them to be in violation of the above Code of Conduct or academic integrity standards.

**Plagiarism**

Plagiarism occurs when you use another's intellectual property (words or ideas) and do not acknowledge that you have done so. Plagiarism is a very serious offense. If it is found that you have plagiarized — deliberately or inadvertently — you will face serious consequences.

The best way to avoid plagiarism is to cite your sources \- both within the body of your assignment and in a bibliography of sources you used at the end of your document.

We recommend you abide by the following guidelines on citation developed by **MIT libraries** (see links below).

You must cite:

* Facts, figures, ideas, or other information that are not common knowledge  
* Ideas, words, theories, or exact language that another person used in other publications  
* Publications that must be cited include: books, book chapters, articles, web pages, theses, etc.  
* Another person's exact words should be quoted and cited to show proper credit  
* When in doubt, be safe and cite your source\!

**Internet Research**

Materials gathered through research via the Internet must be cited in the same manner as more traditionally published material. Lack of such citation constitutes plagiarism.

For additional information on how to avoid plagiarism please refer to the following sources:

* [Avoiding Plagiarism](https://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/). From the MIT Writing and Communication Centre.

* [Plagiarism](https://wts.indiana.edu/writing-guides/index.html): What It is and How to Recognize and Avoid It. From Indiana University's Writing Tutorial Services.

* [Plagiarism](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/01/)\- Overview. A resource from Purdue University.

**Copying and other forms of academic dishonesty**

Copying from other students, answer cheats, or materials from old courses, or from solutions on the shared sites is considered cheating and is never permitted.

Other forms of dishonest academic behaviour that could result in disciplinary action include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Changing the answers on an exam for re-grade;  
* Misrepresenting a family or personal situation to get an extension;  
* Using prohibited resources during a test or other academic work;  
* Forging a faculty member’s signature on a permission form or add/drop form;  
* Falsifying data or claiming to have done research you did not do;  
* Claiming work of others as your own by deliberately not citing them;  
* Assisting another student in doing any of the above.

**Usage of AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT)**

Unless otherwise stated, you are allowed to use AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) for your team assignments.  
Proper usage of these tools is intended to help (but not replace) your learning process. For example,  
ChatGPT can help with your coding and debugging. You are responsible for verifying the correctness of your team’s submission. For academic integrity, include the shared chat link from AI tools in your submission.

**Citation Style**

There is no one standard citation style used at ASB; therefore, we recommend you ask your professor or AM which style is preferred for their corresponding course. If you are unfamiliar or uncertain about how to apply a specific style, we recommend you consult a style guide for examples.

Below we provide a list with some common citation styles:

* MLA: Modern Language Association \[Humanities\]  
* APA: American Psychological Association \[Social Sciences\]  
* CMS: Chicago Manual of Style \[various subjects\]  
* ACS: American Chemical Society  
* CBE: Council of Biology Editors  
* IEEE: Institute of Electronics & Electrical Engineer  
* NLM: National Library of Medicine or AMA: American Medical Association
